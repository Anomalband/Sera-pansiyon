**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
   Future Tasks:
    - **GitHub Deployment (User Action):** The user wants to push the code to GitHub. The agent has already determined that the git remote is not configured and has provided the user with the necessary commands. The next agent should reiterate that this is a manual step for the user to complete.
    - **Backend Integration (Potential):** The application is currently frontend-only. The user may request backend integration in the future to manage content dynamically, replacing the  file. This is not an active request.

**Completed work in this session**
- Built a complete, multi-section landing page for Sera Pansiyon from scratch.
- Implemented and refined the design through multiple user-driven iterations (dark theme, light theme, parallax effects).
- Replaced all stock photography with user-provided real photos, integrating them into components and CSS backgrounds.
- Fixed scroll-triggered animation glitches by implementing the  API.
- Customized  to remove Emergent branding and add custom SEO meta tags and a title.
- Cleaned up the image gallery component () and data () based on specific user feedback (removing categories, re-categorizing images).

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - None. All issues raised during the session, including image loading problems and animation glitches, were resolved.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, Create React App (CRA), Craco
- **Styling:** Custom CSS (), inline styles for dynamic background images.
- **Animations:** CSS transitions and keyframes triggered by JavaScript's  API.
- **Data Management:** All application content is centralized in a single JavaScript object in .

**key DB schema**
  - N/A (The application is frontend-only and does not use a database).

**changes in tech stack**
  - None.

**All files of reference**
- : The source of all text and image paths for the website.

- : A section using a dynamic background image.
- : The image gallery component.
- : The main HTML file, updated for SEO and branding removal.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The use of inline styles for background images in components like , , and  could be moved to the  stylesheet for better code organization, but it is currently functional.

**key api endpoints**
- N/A.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **The application is 100% frontend-only.** Do not attempt to integrate the backend unless specifically requested by the user. All content is managed in .
- Image paths from the  folder should be referenced directly, e.g., .
- The user is very detail-oriented. **You must use the screenshot tool to verify every visual change** before presenting it to the user.
- The user's request to push to GitHub cannot be completed by the agent because the remote repository is not configured. Inform the user that they must set up the remote themselves.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
  - None.
